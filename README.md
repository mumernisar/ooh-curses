# 🧙‍♂️ Ooh Curses

**Ooh Curses** is a fun and slightly unhinged accountability app that cheers you on—or roasts you mercilessly.

You sign up. You check in. You stay on track.

Or... you don’t. And then AI sends a lighthearted _curse_ to your inbox.  
Stick to the plan? Get a wholesome joke instead.
